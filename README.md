# prism-twig2
A new definition for twig in prism. Basically a advanced html thing, with own classes to handle twig tags inside html tags. 

Thanks to all contributors of Prism.js, what a lovely tool. Basically i just copied their work and improved it a bit to work good with twig.

You have to add the index.js to your project and the prism.twig2.css, but if you want you can override the Styling, because it's only modified for the "Okaidia" theme
